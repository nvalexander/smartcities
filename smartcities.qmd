Smart City Development (SCD) is one of the most prevalent paradigms in urban planning in the developed world, emerging as a response to post-industrial demographic transformations. In developed countries, including the United States (US), urban population declined from the 1930s until the 1990s, owing to the demographic decline of populations born in these cities and the loss of many jobs requiring physical presence in urban areas. But, unexpectedly, the Shrinking Cities transformation stopped about three decades ago and first-world urban populations are once again increasing (@Baudet-MichelChapitredecroissanceurbaine2021; @FreyNewcensusdata2024; @MinisteriodeTransportesMovilidadyAgendaUrbanaDGdeViviendaySueloAreasurbanasEspana2022; @NationalRecordsofScotlandWebTeamPopulationGrowsLarge2021). On the other hand, in developing countries, there are large demographic shifts from rural to urban environments, replicating the earlier population flow experienced by the developed world in the early 20th century (@UnitedNationsDepartmentofEconomicandSocialAffairsPopulationDivisionWorldCities20182018).

There is concern that an increase in urban densities could lead to a loss of quality of life (QoL), as witnessed in the West in the early 20th century. Despite significant changes in city zoning and building codes, recent cross-sectional observational studies indicate an inverse correlation between subjective well-being and population density in US cities (@WintersUrbanisationnaturalamenities2016). On the other hand, similar studies conducted in Western Europe (@MouratidisCompactcityurban2019) or focused on specific age cohorts (@Okulicz-KozarynNourbanmalaise2019) suggest that this inverse correlation is not universally present. Several attempts to explain this discrepancy start assume the inclusion of Type II statistical errors, or epoch-specific idiosyncrasies within each sample. A third hypothesis attributes the difference between American and European density - QoL relationship to cultural differences, as captured by the witticism "Americans live to work, while Europeans work to live." (@Okulicz-KozarynEuropeansworklive2011) This approach suggests that culture-specific social structures facilitate Europeans' higher tolerance for increased demographic density. A relevant implication would be that policies allowing Americans to live similarly to Western Europeans could improve the formers' perception of high urban density.

SCD can be seen as a practical application of this corollary. Experts from both sides of the Atlantic believe that cities with shorter distances between key locations, public spaces facilitating social interactions, accessible public transport, and green spaces tend to provide a better QoL at the same objective level of demographic density, compared to cities developed around the personal automobile or gated communities. Furthermore, they argue that an active effort to reshape cities from an individualistic to a more community-focused model would enhance urban residents' QoL (@CaragliuSmartcitiesEurope2011; @NivolaAreEuropescities1999). This trend toward community-oriented urban development is generally linked to the belief that the introduction of novel technologies, such as real-time monitoring, may counter potential urban decline. Within this framework, the European Commission (EC) has defined the smart city as "a place where traditional networks and services are made more efficient with the use of digital solutions for the benefit of its inhabitants and business." (@EuropeanCommissionSmartcities2016) Among the goals set by the EC for developing smart cities are the efficient use of local resources, pollution minimization, improved availability of public transportation, safe drinking water and sanitation infrastructure, energy-efficient lighting and heating, and streamlined citizen-authority interactions. In short, the European understanding of SCD stresses QoL improvement.

By contrast, in the US, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines SCD as "the effective use of digital technologies to deliver prioritized services and benefits to achieve community goals." (@SerranoSmartcitiescommunities2022) In addition to improved services, NIST criteria for a smart city include the alignment of metrics and budget priorities with citizens preferences, investment optimization, and rich information streams. While these gauges can be useful in evaluating cities or city governments' efforts, the cost-effective structure of NIST's goals is notable. It is indeed intuitive that SCD evaluation should include a metric of public investment efficiency, but it is unclear how this efficiency can be measured in a smart way. For example, it is unclear whether an urban highway is a smart amenity. A highway is superior in terms of speed to a bicycle lane, but, at the same time, urban highways degrades the well-being of the supposed beneficiaries, to the point that, even in the US, housing near the highway is sold at a discount (@Samuelspollutedlifehighway2022). According to the NIST definition, US urban planners were the first in the world to apply intelligent city management techniques, in 1970, when they used aerial photographs to assess the quality of Los Angeles' housing stock (@StubingerUnderstandingSmartCity2020). Again, it is not immediately obvious how this approach improved the quality of life of the residents of the city surveyed in this hi-tech manner. Arguably, in the US understanding of the term "smart city", the purpose is subordinated to the process.

Between the concept of the smart city as defined by the EC and the one defined by the NIST, there exists a broad spectrum of definitions, ranging from those centered on QoL to those focused on the novelty of development methods. According to a recent European review (@BolivarsearchSmartSource2019), the various definitions encompass, with varying emphasis, "smart economy, smart people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart environment, and smart living". Unfortunately, almost all the articles cited in this review offer definitions without applying them to concrete data, and, therefore, without quantive scaling for any of the criteria. Such an approach makes it impossible to compare cities based on SCD indices, or even to appreciate dynamics within the same city. We are aware of only one study that provides quantitative evidence supporting the correlation between QoL and a numeric composite metric of SCD using the previously mentioned six domains (@WangDoessmartcity2023), but it is limited to China. A quantitative assessment of SCD in the US and the EU is urgently needed, given that its theoretical foundation - the hypothesis that a communal way of life is superior to an individualistic one in terms of QoL - appears accepted solely on axiomatic grounds, and yet it guides the development of several first-order urban centers (New York and Vienna, among others reviewed in @Choicomparativeanalysisseven2023).

In this study, we analyze quantitatively the correlation between the SCD and QoL. SCD metrics were obtained from two European academic centers, the International Institute for Management Development (IMD) in Lausanne and the Instituto de Estudios Superiores de la Empresa (IESE) in Barcelona. Both institutions host expert groups, who publish periodic world SCD city rankings, based on published, well-defined SCD criteria. Additionally, both sets of rankings include domain metrics, allowing identification of stronger and weaker SCD domains in the assessed cities. For general QoL rankings, we use, as a starting point, the scores from the well-known US News & World (USNW) report ranking US cities, based on quantitative and survey data. For a deeper understanding of QoL components, we use the publicly-available data from Numbeo.com, an online platform where anonymous resident ratings and several well-published indicators are combined, through specified formulas, into domain indices. The analysis was limited to US cities, primarily because a narower geographic focus reduces potential cultural confounders, such as language differences in questionnaires and intercultural axiological differences.

## Research hypotheses

H1. SCD metrics from IESE and IMD have a strong degree of correlation, indicating that they measure similar concepts.

H2. Domain SCD metrics for a city are largely correlated, indicating that local authorities pursue systemic rather than domain-specific improvements.

H3. SCD metrics from the same group of experts are correlated over time, indicating that local authorities show a persistent interest (or lack of interest) in SCD.

H4. QoL metrics from USNW and Number.com have a strong degree of correlation, indicating that they measure similar concepts.

H5. QoL metrics and SCD metrics correlate in cross-sectional analysis, demonstrating an effect of SCD-oriented policies on QoL in US cities.

H6. The correlation between QoL metrics and SCD metrics is domain-specific, with certain SCD domains (for example, smart transportation) showing stronger associations with QoL than others.

H6. The correlation between QoL metrics and SCD metrics is domain-specific, with certain SCD domains (for example, leisure time) showing stronger associations with QoL than others.

## Data acquisition and processing

Ten US cities were evaluated in the most recent wave of the IMD Smart Cities Index, in 2023 (@BrisIMDSmartCity2023). The IMD data include an estimate of the Human Development Index (HDI) at city level, a survey on the top five Concerns of the resident population, and a survey on the Structures and Technologies supporting SCD. The latter assesses five domains: governance, health and safety, mobility, professional development opportunities, and leisure activities (copied from @BrisIMDSmartCity2023 in Supplemental Table 1). The IMD methodology has been significantly changed several times, thus limiting the usefulness of its stability across time. The number of respondents is not specified, but it is stated to be representative. IMD data were semi-automatically transcribed from the document available at imd.org.

The SCD indicators obtained from IESE include solely a score and a rank. However, correlation between IESE scores with IMD scores would be supportive for the notion of a relative agreement among experts, with regards to SCD metrics. Moreover, IESE criteria have been rather invariable, making IESE rankings useful in evaluation of eventual chronologic trends with regards to expert-generated SCD rankings. In 2024, the IESE criteria covered nine domains, namely human capital, social cohesion, economy, governance, environment, mobility, international profile, urban planning, and technology (copied from @BerroneIESECitiesMotion2024 in Supplemental Table 2). The IESE overall rankings and scores data were transcribed semi-automatically from documents published at iese.edu, and cover 8 US cities assessed in IESE Cities in Motion 2014 (@BerroneIESECitiesMotion2014), as well as 19 US cities in IESE Cities in Motion 2024 (@BerroneIESECitiesMotion2024). 

For QoL, we used USNW rankings, compiled by experts for over fifty years and highly influential in shaping American public perception (@Bloom25Citiesbest2024). In the Best Places to Live 2023-2024 rankings, QoL scores comprise 36% of the overal desirability score of a city. QoL scores are computed from metrics of subjective well-being, crime rates, education quality, commute quality, environment quality, and quality of healthcare services, with weights derived from US surveys (copied from @Howwerank2024 in Supplemental Table 3). USNW does not publish domain-specific QoL metrics. The overall QoL score was manually extracted from the Best Places to Live and Retire 2023 ranking (@BestPlacesLive2023), available at usnews.com.

Since 2009, Numbeo.com has hosted a web platform where self-selected, anonymous users, authenticating with their email address, may rate cities acrss the world, based on criteria such as cost of living, cost of housing  as a proportion of income, safety, healthcare services, climate, pollution, and commute burden. Although there are concerns regarding data quality, as with any internet-based survey, each of the studied cities has over 200 reviews, which reduces the impact of malicious responses. Moreover, in addition to survey data, Numbeo also incorporates a few official public data in the calculation of its composite indices (detailed, based on, in Supplemental Table 4). Numbeo is considered the best available source, especially for local prices, by major media outlets such as The Economist (@LStaletwoecosystems2013), Forbes (@BarrettInvestigateYouExpatriate2010), and The New York Times (@KugelThingsYouCan2016). We manually collected overall QoL scores, as well as scores for its eight dimensions, from numbeo.com, as displayed in April 2024. 

Although USNW and Numbeo.com provide QoL ratings for hundreds and, respectively thousands of US cities, the number of cities ranked by IESE and IMD is typically around 100 across the world. For teh most part we analyzed data for all the 19 US cities featured the IESE 2024 rankings, but only 4 US cities (New York, Los Angeles, Chivago and Philadelphia) were assessed in all three reports used for this study.

- Air Quality Index (7%) uses the homonymous index from the Environmental Protection Agency. 
- National Risk Index (5%) uses risk to 18 types of natural hazards from Federal Emergency Management Agency, and community risk factors, including social vulnerability and community resilience.

### Supplemental Table 4. Numbero.com QoL score components (paraphrased from numbeo.com, as of April 2024)

The Cost of Living Index is a weighted mean of readers' submitted prices for:

- Restaurants (such as McMeal at McDonalds, Meal at Inexpensive Restaurant, Meal at Mid-range Restaurant, Domestic Beer, Imported Beer and so on)
- Food Markets
- Transportation
- Utilities
- Sports And Leisure

The Purchasing Power Index is the ratio between:

- readers' submitted rents and Cost of Living prices (from the previous indicator)
- readers' submitted net salaries.

The Property Price to Income Ratio (sometimes referred to as Housing Affordability) estimates the number of years of family income required to purchase a typical apartment outright, without a mortgage.

- Family income is calculated as 1.5 times the net salaries submitted by readers.
- The typical apartment has 90 square meters, and is not located in downtown areas. Prices are submitted by readers.

The Safety Index (sometimes referred to by its inverse, Crime Index), based on readers' responses about:

- General perception of crime levels
- Perceived safety during daylight and nighttime
- Concerns about specific crimes (mugging, robbery, car theft, physical attacks, public harassment, and bias-motivated incidents)
- Property crime severity (burglary, theft, vandalism)
- Violent crime severity (assault, homicide, sexual offenses).

The Healthcare Quality uses readers' responses about healthcare providers, be they individuals or orgnizations, from the point of view of:

- skill and competency
- speed
- modern equipment
- accuracy and completeness
- friendliness and courtesy
- responsiveness waitings
- location
- cost.

The Climate Index is calculated from the temperature and dew point (unspecifid source).

The Pollution Index is calculated from data, from World Health Organization and from readers, about:

- Air and Water Pollution
- Garbage Disposal and Cleanliness
- Noise and Light Pollution
- Availability of Green Spaces
- Overall Pollution Comfort.

Traffic and Commute Times Index is calculated using reader's submitted estimates for:
