\maketitle


Smart City Development (SCD) is one of the most prevalent paradigms in
urban planning in the developed world, emerging as a response to
post-industrial demographic transformations. In developed countries,
including the United States (US), urban population declined from the
1930s until the 1990s, owing to the demographic decline of populations
born in these cities and the loss of many jobs requiring physical
presence in urban areas. But, unexpectedly, the Shrinking Cities
transformation stopped about three decades ago and first-world urban
populations are once again increasing (Baudet-Michel and Paulus
(\citeproc{ref-Baudet-MichelChapitredecroissanceurbaine2021}{2021});
Frey (\citeproc{ref-FreyNewcensusdata2024}{2024}); Ministerio de
Transportes, Movilidad y Agenda Urbana, DG de Vivienda y Suelo
(\citeproc{ref-MinisteriodeTransportesMovilidadyAgendaUrbanaDGdeViviendaySueloAreasurbanasEspana2022}{2022});
National Records of Scotland Web Team
(\citeproc{ref-NationalRecordsofScotlandWebTeamPopulationGrowsLarge2021}{2021})).
On the other hand, in developing countries, there are large demographic
shifts from rural to urban environments, replicating the earlier
population flow experienced by the developed world in the early 20th
century (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs,
Population Division
(\citeproc{ref-UnitedNationsDepartmentofEconomicandSocialAffairsPopulationDivisionWorldCities20182018}{2018})).

There is concern that an increase in urban densities could lead to a
loss of quality of life (QoL), as witnessed in the West in the early
20th century. Despite significant changes in city zoning and building
codes, recent cross-sectional observational studies indicate an inverse
correlation between subjective well-being and population density in US
cities (Winters and Li
(\citeproc{ref-WintersUrbanisationnaturalamenities2016}{2016})). On the
other hand, similar studies conducted in Western Europe (Mouratidis
(\citeproc{ref-MouratidisCompactcityurban2019}{2019})) or focused on
specific age cohorts (Okulicz-Kozaryn and Valente
(\citeproc{ref-Okulicz-KozarynNourbanmalaise2019}{2019})) suggest that
this inverse correlation is not universally present. Several attempts to
explain this discrepancy start assume the inclusion of Type II
statistical errors, or epoch-specific idiosyncrasies within each sample.
A third hypothesis attributes the difference between American and
European density - QoL relationship to cultural differences, as captured
by the witticism ``Americans live to work, while Europeans work to
live.'' (Okulicz-Kozaryn
(\citeproc{ref-Okulicz-KozarynEuropeansworklive2011}{2011})) This
approach suggests that culture-specific social structures facilitate
Europeans' higher tolerance for increased demographic density. A
relevant implication would be that policies allowing Americans to live
similarly to Western Europeans could improve the formers' perception of
high urban density.

SCD can be seen as a practical application of this corollary. Experts
from both sides of the Atlantic believe that cities with shorter
distances between key locations, public spaces facilitating social
interactions, accessible public transport, and green spaces tend to
provide a better QoL at the same objective level of demographic density,
compared to cities developed around the personal automobile or gated
communities. Furthermore, they argue that an active effort to reshape
cities from an individualistic to a more community-focused model would
enhance urban residents' QoL (Caragliu, Bo, and Nijkamp
(\citeproc{ref-CaragliuSmartcitiesEurope2011}{2011}); Nivola
(\citeproc{ref-NivolaAreEuropescities1999}{1999})). This trend toward
community-oriented urban development is generally linked to the belief
that the introduction of novel technologies, such as real-time
monitoring, may counter potential urban decline. Within this framework,
the European Commission (EC) has defined the smart city as ``a place
where traditional networks and services are made more efficient with the
use of digital solutions for the benefit of its inhabitants and
business.'' (European Commission
(\citeproc{ref-EuropeanCommissionSmartcities2016}{2016})) Among the
goals set by the EC for developing smart cities are the efficient use of
local resources, pollution minimization, improved availability of public
transportation, safe drinking water and sanitation infrastructure,
energy-efficient lighting and heating, and streamlined citizen-authority
interactions. In short, the European understanding of SCD stresses QoL
improvement.

By contrast, in the US, the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) defines SCD as ``the effective use of digital
technologies to deliver prioritized services and benefits to achieve
community goals.'' (Serrano et al.
(\citeproc{ref-SerranoSmartcitiescommunities2022}{2022})) In addition to
improved services, NIST criteria for a smart city include the alignment
of metrics and budget priorities with citizens preferences, investment
optimization, and rich information streams. While these gauges can be
useful in evaluating cities or city governments' efforts, the
cost-effective structure of NIST's goals is notable. It is indeed
intuitive that SCD evaluation should include a metric of public
investment efficiency, but it is unclear how this efficiency can be
measured in a smart way. For example, it is unclear whether an urban
highway is a smart amenity. A highway is superior in terms of speed to a
bicycle lane, but, at the same time, urban highways degrades the
well-being of the supposed beneficiaries, to the point that, even in the
US, housing near the highway is sold at a discount (Samuels and Freemark
(\citeproc{ref-Samuelspollutedlifehighway2022}{2022})). According to the
NIST definition, US urban planners were the first in the world to apply
intelligent city management techniques, in 1970, when they used aerial
photographs to assess the quality of Los Angeles' housing stock
(Stübinger and Schneider
(\citeproc{ref-StubingerUnderstandingSmartCity2020}{2020})). Again, it
is not immediately obvious how this approach improved the quality of
life of the residents of the city surveyed in this hi-tech manner.
Arguably, in the US understanding of the term ``smart city'', the
purpose is subordinated to the process.

Between the concept of the smart city as defined by the EC and the one
defined by the NIST, there exists a broad spectrum of definitions,
ranging from those centered on QoL to those focused on the novelty of
development methods. According to a recent European review (Bolívar
(\citeproc{ref-BolivarsearchSmartSource2019}{2019})), the various
definitions encompass, with varying emphasis, ``smart economy, smart
people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart environment, and smart
living''. Unfortunately, almost all the articles cited in this review
offer definitions without applying them to concrete data, and,
therefore, without quantive scaling for any of the criteria. Such an
approach makes it impossible to compare cities based on SCD indices, or
even to appreciate dynamics within the same city. We are aware of only
one study that provides quantitative evidence supporting the correlation
between QoL and a numeric composite metric of SCD using the previously
mentioned six domains (Wang and Zhou
(\citeproc{ref-WangDoessmartcity2023}{2023})), but it is limited to
China. A quantitative assessment of SCD in the US and the EU is urgently
needed, given that its theoretical foundation - the hypothesis that a
communal way of life is superior to an individualistic one in terms of
QoL - appears accepted solely on axiomatic grounds, and yet it guides
the development of several first-order urban centers (New York and
Vienna, among others reviewed in Choi and Caicedo
(\citeproc{ref-Choicomparativeanalysisseven2023}{2023})).

In this study, we analyze quantitatively the correlation between the SCD
and QoL. SCD metrics were obtained from two European academic centers,
the International Institute for Management Development (IMD) in Lausanne
and the Instituto de Estudios Superiores de la Empresa (IESE) in
Barcelona. Both institutions host expert groups, who publish periodic
world SCD city rankings, based on published, well-defined SCD criteria.
Additionally, both sets of rankings include domain metrics, allowing
identification of stronger and weaker SCD domains in the assessed
cities. For general QoL rankings, we use, as a starting point, the
scores from the well-known US News \& World (USNW) report ranking US
cities, based on quantitative and survey data. For a deeper
understanding of QoL components, we use the publicly-available data from
Numbeo.com, an online platform where anonymous resident ratings and
several well-published indicators are combined, through specified
formulas, into domain indices. The analysis was limited to US cities,
primarily because a narower geographic focus reduces potential cultural
confounders, such as language differences in questionnaires and
intercultural axiological differences.

\section{Research hypotheses}\label{research-hypotheses}

H1. SCD metrics from IESE and IMD have a strong degree of correlation,
indicating that they measure similar concepts.

H2. SCD metrics from the same group of experts are correlated over time,
indicating that local authorities show a persistent interest (or lack of
interest) in SCD.

H3. Domain SCD metrics for a city are largely correlated, indicating
that local authorities pursue systemic rather than domain-specific
improvements.

H4. QoL metrics from USNW and Number.com have a strong degree of
correlation, indicating that they measure similar concepts.

H5. QoL metrics and SCD metrics correlate in cross-sectional analysis,
demonstrating an effect of SCD-oriented policies on QoL in US cities.

H6. The correlation between QoL metrics and SCD metrics is
domain-specific, with certain SCD domains (for example, smart
transportation) showing stronger associations with QoL than others.

H6. The correlation between QoL metrics and SCD metrics is
domain-specific, with certain SCD domains (for example, leisure time)
showing stronger associations with QoL than others.

\section{Data acquisition and
processing}\label{data-acquisition-and-processing}

Ten US cities were evaluated in the most recent wave of the IMD Smart
Cities Index, in 2023 (Bris et al.
(\citeproc{ref-BrisIMDSmartCity2023}{2023})). The IMD data include an
estimate of the Human Development Index (HDI) at city level, a survey on
the top five Concerns of the resident population, and a survey on the
Structures and Technologies supporting SCD. The latter assesses five
domains: governance, health and safety, mobility, professional
development opportunities, and leisure activities (copied from Bris et
al. (\citeproc{ref-BrisIMDSmartCity2023}{2023}) in Supplemental Table
1). Although the IMD report provides rankings and score from past years,
the IMD methodology has changed repeatedly and significantly, making
time series analysis less reliable. The number of respondents is not
specified, but it is stated to be representative. IMD data were
semi-automatically transcribed from the document available at imd.org.

The SCD indicators obtained from IESE include solely a score (Cities in
Motion Index, CIMI) and rankings based on that score. However,
correlation between IESE scores with IMD scores would be supportive for
the notion of a relative agreement among experts, with regards to SCD
metrics. Moreover, IESE criteria have been rather invariable, making
IESE rankings useful in evaluation of eventual chronologic trends with
regards to expert-generated SCD rankings. In 2024, the IESE criteria
covered nine domains, namely human capital, social cohesion, economy,
governance, environment, mobility, international profile, urban
planning, and technology (copied from Berrone et al.
(\citeproc{ref-BerroneIESECitiesMotion2024}{2024}) in Supplemental Table
2). The IESE overall rankings and scores data were transcribed
semi-automatically from documents published at iese.edu, and cover 8 US
cities assessed in IESE Cities in Motion 2014 (Berrone et al.
(\citeproc{ref-BerroneIESECitiesMotion2014}{2014})), as well as 19 US
cities in IESE Cities in Motion 2024 (Berrone et al.
(\citeproc{ref-BerroneIESECitiesMotion2024}{2024})).

For QoL, we used USNW rankings, compiled by experts for over fifty years
and highly influential in shaping American public perception (Bloom
(\citeproc{ref-Bloom25Citiesbest2024}{2024})). In the Best Places to
Live 2023-2024 rankings, QoL scores comprise 36\% of the overal
desirability score of a city. QoL scores are computed from metrics of
subjective well-being, crime rates, education quality, commute quality,
environment quality, and quality of healthcare services, with weights
derived from US surveys (copied from {``How We Rank the {Best Places to
Live and Retire}''} (\citeproc{ref-Howwerank2024}{n.d.}) in Supplemental
Table 3). USNW does not publish domain-specific QoL metrics. The overall
QoL score was manually extracted from the Best Places to Live and Retire
2023 ranking ({``Best {Places to Live} for Quality of Life, Ranked''}
(\citeproc{ref-BestPlacesLive2023}{2023})), available at usnews.com.

Since 2009, Numbeo.com has hosted a web platform where self-selected,
anonymous users, authenticating with their email address, may rate
cities acrss the world, based on criteria such as cost of living, cost
of housing as a proportion of income, safety, healthcare services,
climate, pollution, and commute burden. Although there are concerns
regarding data quality, as with any internet-based survey, each of the
studied cities has over 200 reviews, which reduces the impact of
malicious responses. Moreover, in addition to survey data, Numbeo also
incorporates a few official public data in the calculation of its
composite indices (detailed, based on, in Supplemental Table 4). Numbeo
is considered the best available source, especially for local prices, by
major media outlets such as The Economist (L.S.
(\citeproc{ref-LStaletwoecosystems2013}{2013})), Forbes (Barrett
(\citeproc{ref-BarrettInvestigateYouExpatriate2010}{2010})), and The New
York Times (Kugel (\citeproc{ref-KugelThingsYouCan2016}{2016})). We
manually collected overall QoL scores, as well as scores for its eight
dimensions, from numbeo.com, as displayed in April 2024.

Manually-loaded data was pasted in LibreOffice Calc 25.2.2, and the
resulting raw spreadsheet has been shared at TODO. Subsequently, data
was imported in VSCode 1.99.3, processed and analyzed with R 4.2.2 (R
Core Team
(\citeproc{ref-RCoreTeamlanguageenvironmentstatistical2021}{2021})), and
typeset with Quarto 1.7.29. Data wrangling and visualization relied on
the tidyverse R library, version 2.0.0 (Wickham et al.
(\citeproc{ref-tidyverse2019}{2019})).

Although USNW and Numbeo.com provide QoL ratings for hundreds and,
respectively thousands of US cities, the number of cities ranked by IESE
and IMD is typically around 100 across the world. For the most part we
analyzed data for all the 19 US cities featured the IESE 2024 rankings,
but only 4 US cities (New York, Los Angeles, Chivago and Philadelphia)
were assessed in all three reports used for this study. A set of 76
variables were obtained, including 59 metrics of SDC from IMD, 4 SCD
metrics from IESE, 9 QoL metrics from Numbeo.com, 2 QoL metrics from
USNW, and a control variable (overall USNW score).

Among the 75 relevant variables 40\% of the data was missing.
Missingness ranged from 13 variables with fewer than 10\% missing data
to 3 varaibles from IEsE 2014 with more than 50\% missingness. The
overall mean skewness was low (mean absolute skewness 0.07), suggesting
limited departure from normality. Within the SCD-related variable set,
17.2\% of pairs had an absolute Pearson correlation greater than 0.7,
suggestign some redundancy among predictors. Among QoL-related
variables, 3.6\% of pairs exceeded this threshold, indicating minimal
multicollinearity.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{IESE and IMD rankings evaluate similar
constructs}\label{iese-and-imd-rankings-evaluate-similar-constructs}

Normality of the IESE 2024 and IMD 2023 ranks was assessed using
Shapiro-Wilk tests, which indicated no significant deviation from
normality (p = 0.161 and p = 0.664, respectively). The IESE composite
score, however, showed significant non-normality (p = 1.09e-04).
Accordingly, Pearson correlation was used to assess the association
between IESE and IMD rankings. The positive correlation was strong (r =
0.73, p = 0.016, df = 17).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{smartcities_files/figure-pdf/imdvsiese-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{Scatterplots illustrating the correlation between IMD 2023
rankings and IESE 2024 indicators.}

\end{figure}%

Figure 1 illustrates the non-normality of IESE CIMI scores, introduced
by the much higher score attributed to New York. . Given the
non-normality of the IESE composite score, Spearman's rho was used to
assess its association with the IMD ranking. The rank-based correlation
was -0.53 (p = 0.123, df = 17). Although the latter test was not
statistically significant, the former test indicates that IESE and IMD
rankings capture broadly similar dimensions.

\subsection{Expert SCD ratings are stable in
time}\label{expert-scd-ratings-are-stable-in-time}

Pairwise Pearson correlation analysis between consecutive IMD reports
indicate stability of IMD rankings over time. The correlation between
2019 and 2020 was high (r = 0.78, p = 0.013), as was the correlation
between 2020 and 2021 (r = 0.97, p = 3.04e-06), and between 2021 and
2023 (r = 0.97, 5.74e-06). To summarize the overall consistency across
years, we computed the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), using a
one-way random-effects model. The ICC was 0.77, significantly greater
than zero (F(8, 27) = 14, p = 8.18e-08), with a 95\% confidence interval
ranging from 0.51 to 0.93. These results suggest a strong persistence of
relative city rankings across the observed period.

\caption{Trajectories of IMD Smart City rankings for each city
(2019--2023)}

\end{figure}%

In addition to the statistical analysis, a plot of IMD ranks across the
four timepoints (Fig. 2) supports the notion of stable rankings, with
the general decreasing tend explained by the addition of non-US cities
that rank extremely well by IMD metrics (Canberra, Wellington,
Reykjavik, Lausanne), in a manner that does not affect the US
hierarachy.

\subsection{SCD ratings components correlate moderate between domains,
with the exception of reported
Concerns}\label{scd-ratings-components-correlate-moderate-between-domains-with-the-exception-of-reported-concerns}

Surprisingly, in the IMD survey, which provides domain metrics, not all
of the four components of the SCD assessement correlate well between
cities. Specifically, Pearson correlation analysis did not support a
correlation between HDI and the sum of IMD Technologies indicators (r =
0.27, p = 0.455). In contrast, the correlation between HDI and the sum
of IMD Structures indicators was r = 0.62, p = 0.058. The correlation
between IMD Technologies and IMD Structures was r = 0.61, p = 0.063.

Of note, the IMD Concerns sum significantly from normality (p = 0.018),
unlike the other three IMD domains. Therefore, for associations
involving the non-normally distributed IMD Concerns sum, Spearman
correlations were used instead. Evidence of a correlation between HDI
and IMD Concerns was found using Spearman's method (ρ = -0.71, p =
0.02). On the other hand, there was no evidence for an association
between Technologies and Concerns (ρ = -0.46, p = 0.184), nor for the
association between Structures and Concerns (ρ = -0.57, p = 0.083).

A plot of these potential correlation (Fig. 3) indicates confirms that
IMD Concerns scores are not normally distributed, with an extremely low
sum of Concerns indicators for Denver. Nevertheless, Denver's exclusion
fails to improve statistical significance between the sum of IMD
Concerns indicators and the other domain indicator sums (data not
shown).
